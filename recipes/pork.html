    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These pork chops with cream of mushroom soup are quick and easy, but very delicious. This is one of my family's favorite dinners served with brown rice.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.</li>
        <li>Brown chops on both sides over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet; transfer browned chops to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and onion to the same skillet and sauté for one minute.</li>
        <li>Arrange browned chops on top of mushroom mixture. Pour soup over chops. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until chops are cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
